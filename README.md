# Java-Rescursion-Linked-List-Assignment
Fall 2021 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms I Assignment 4

Target Topic: Recursion

For this assignment you are asked to write RECURSIVE methods to implement the following
tasks. These methods MUST be placed as part of functioning programs, you can submit them in
separate files/folders. But ALL classes that are needed to test your method possible MUST be
submitted.

1. Write a recursive void method to display a single-ended singly linked list backwards.
2. Write a recursive boolean returning method to check and see whether a double-ended
doubly linked list that stores a series of characters form a palindrome or not.
3. BONUS: Write a recursive int returning method that computes raising a base to a
power BASED ON ADDITION. Define a recursive multiplication method based on addition,
and then use that to define the power method. This is called indirect recursion. Where a method
does not directly call itself, but it calls another method that does: so it is called in its definition
indirectly via another method call.

Again: Submit each of these methods within a working program, include EVERY CLASS you
need to test each of your methods. An incomplete submission will not be accepted.

You must use ONLY the textbook code and not any Java classes. The violation of this rule,
makes your submission void.

No report is required for this assignment.
